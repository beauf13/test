& recycling tips. Don’t put recycling in plastic bags. Lids and labels can stay on. Give cardboard items the ‘tear test’. Ignore the plastics identification number. (City of Sydney, n.d) Love your leftovers: Enjoy them for a snack or another meal. Use the entire vegetable - stalks and peel make tasty stocks. Sort single-use items properly: Disposable masks and coffee cups must go in the rubbish (red lid) bin. Plastic takeaway containers can be re-used to store food or other items. If you can’t re-use them, they can be recycled in your yellow lid bin. Just make sure they're clean - empty food and liquids. Keep soft plastics out of the bins: Plastic bags, bread bags and food wrappers can’t be recycled in your home recycling bin. Book a RecycleSmart pickup and have them collected from your doorstep. You can also take them to soft plastic drop-off points at your local supermarket. Look for the RedCycle bin. Think yellow for hard plastics: Packaging that keeps its structure or bounces back when you try squashing it (like a biscuit tray) goes into your yellow lid bin. Make space in the bins: Flatten cardboard boxes to fit more in the recycling bin. Keep it loose. We can’t recycle items tied up in plastic bags. Go green: Whether you have a few pots on a balcony or a full backyard, all plants need a bit of maintenance. Recycle your garden waste in the green lid garden organics bin. If you don’t have one, you can order one free. Book a free pick-up for bulky items or a RecycleSmart pickup for smaller ones: City of Sydney residents can have their bulky waste collected once a week. We accept furniture, mattresses, white goods, electronics, and large garden organics, and recycle as much as possible. If you have items that can fit inside a shopping bag, like batteries or broken appliances, book a pickup with RecycleSmart to have them collected from your doorstep.

Often climate change refers specifically to the rise in global temperatures from the mid-20th century to present. (National Geographic, n.d) The three most important problems with landfill are toxins, leachate and greenhouse gases. Toxins Many materials that end up as waste contain toxic substances. Over time, these toxins leach into our soil and groundwater, and become environmental hazards for years. Electronic waste is a good example. Waste such as televisions, computers and other electronic appliances contain a long list of hazardous substances, including mercury, arsenic, cadmium, PVC, solvents, acids and lead. Leachate Leachate is the liquid formed when waste breaks down in the landfill and water filters through that waste. This liquid is highly toxic and can pollute the land, ground water and water ways. In these systems, waste degrades and produces some gases, namely methane gas (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which can cause global climate change.
